<h2><b>ABOUT US</b>
<hr>
<p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the global governing body of the sport cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by Australian, English, and South African representatives. 
In 1965, the body was renamed International Cricket Conference and its current name was adopted in 1987.
 The ICC has its headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The ICC currently has 110 member nations: 12 full members that play the Test format, and 98 associate members.
[4] Timor-Leste Cricket Federation is the latest addition to the associate members list, as of 2025.[5] 
The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's international tournaments, most notably the Men's ODI World Cup, 
Women's ODI World Cup, Men's T20 World Cup, Women's T20 World Cup, World Test Championship, 
Men's Champions Trophy and Women's Champions Trophy</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p style"color:green>
On 30 November 1907, Abe Bailey, the President of the South African Cricket Association, 
wrote a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club's (MCC, England) secretary, Francis Lacey. 
Bailey suggested the formation of an 'Imperial Cricket Board'. In the letter,
 he suggested that the board would be responsible for the formulation of rules and regulations that would govern the bilateral international matches of the three members, Australia, England and South Africa. Bailey wanted to host a Triangular Test series among the participant countries in South Africa. However, Australia rejected the offer. Still, Bailey did not lose hope. He saw an opportunity of getting the three members together during Australia's tour of England in 1909. After continued lobbying and efforts, Bailey was successful.[14]

On 15 June 1909, representatives from England, Australia and South Africa met at Lord's and founded the Imperial Cricket Conference. 
A month later, a second meeting between the three members was held. 
The rules were agreed upon amongst the nations, and the first-ever Tri-Test series was decided to be held in England in 1912.[14]

In 1926, West Indies, New Zealand and India were elected as Full Members, 
doubling the number of Test-playing nations to six. After the formation of Pakistan in 1947, 
it was given Test status five years later in 1952, becoming the seventh Test-playing nation. 
In May 1961, South Africa left the British Commonwealth and therefore lost membership.[14]

n 1964, the ICC agreed to include non-Test playing countries.
 The following year, the ICC changed its name to the International Cricket Conference. 
The US, Ceylon (who later became Sri Lanka) and Fiji were admitted as Associates, 
a new class of members.[15] In 1968, Denmark, Bermuda, Netherlands, and East Africa were admitted as Associates, 
while South Africa had still not applied to rejoin the ICC.

In 1969, the basic rules of ICC were amended. 
At the 1971 meeting, the idea of organizing a World Cup was introduced. 
At the 1973 meeting, it was decided that a World Cup would be played in 1975 in England. 
The six Test-playing nations and East Africa and Sri Lanka were invited to take part.[15]

New members were added frequently during this period: Israel and Singapore in 1974, West Africa in 1976, Bangladesh in 1977,
 Papua-New Guinea in 1978, were admitted as Associates. South Africa applied to rejoin, but their application was rejected.

In 1981, Sri Lanka was promoted to a Full Member, and they played their first Test in 1982.

In 1984, a third class of membership (Affiliate) was introduced. Italy was the first such member, followed by Switzerland in 1985. In 1987, 
the Bahamas and France were admitted, followed by Nepal in 1988.
